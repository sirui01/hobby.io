<h2 id="Eyes">Eyes</h2>
<p>Cats have exceptional eyesight. Particularly in
the early evening and at night, they see better
than humans. Most cats can see kinds of light,
such as ultraviolet, that are invisible to humans. 
<br>One phenomenon of cat vision is the tapetum
lucidum, or “eyeshine”, the glowing of cat’s eyes
in the dark. A layer of iridescent cells at the back
of the eyeball reflects the light, which adds to the
cat’s ability to see at night (Fig. 1).</br></p>

<h2 id="Ears">Ears</h2>
<p>Cats are exceedingly sensitive to sound; their
range of hearing extends well above and below
the range of human hearing. It is probable that
the cat has a keener sense of hearing than most
dogs, since it depends more upon sight and
hearing than smell when hunting.Their ears are cupped which serve as receptors and conductors of sound. When listening, the cat will move its head this way and that, turning its ears in the direction of the sound.
<br>Fig. 2 shows an example of a cat's ears being receptive to a sound that is likely coming from the front.</br></p>

<h2 id="Paws">Paws</h2>
<p>The rubbery, thick pads on your cat's paws cushion their feet and insulate them from weather extremes. Cat's claws are also found here. It is important to keep the nails trimmed and provide scratching surfaces for them! Overall, cat's put alot of wear and tear on their feet and it is important for their paws to be cared for! Fig. 3 shows what a cat's claw usually looks like!</p>

<h2 id="Tail">Tail</h2>
<p>The cat's tail helps them to balance! The tail serves as a counterbalance when cats walk on narrow spaces such as shelves. When a cat is running after a prey item, their tail also aids in balance. 
<br>Additionally, the cat's tail can also be a form of greeting. Usually, a straight-up tail with a hooked tip signals a friendly greeting. Conversely, an aggressive cat may have its tail straight up. Fig. 4 is a useful infographic in showing the different behaviours associated with the cat, as displayed by its tail.</br></p>

<h2 id="Whiskers">Whiskers</h2>
<p>Whiskers are specifically tuned sensory equipment that guide a cat through daily functions. These specialized hairs aid vision and help a cat navigate through its environment, providing additional sensory input, much like antennae on insects. Each whisker is filled with tiny, supersensitive nerves that cats can use for various functions, such as catching their prey or eating a meal.
<br>If you're still curious of how exactly cats use their whiskers, watch this interesting video below!</br></p>
