  <h2>Medication</h2>
  <p>Just like humans, cats might sometimes be feeling slightly under the weather as well. When they get sick, it is best to bring the cats over to a vet. The table below shows a typical cost of some services in the vet.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Service</th>
		<th>Cost</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Consultation</td>
		<td>Ccost ranges from $25~$70++ (depending time of the week of the visit)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Vaccination</td>
		<td>$40~$100</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sterilisation</td>
		<td>$150~$350</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, one can also choose to consider online video consultations with a vet as well. It is a good solution when it is too last minute to book a slot at the vet, or when the nearest vet is too far. 
<br>A good platform is ZumVet Singapore. They offer affordable video calls with professional vets that would dispense you with the appropriate medicine for your cats. Hover about their website for more information.</br>
