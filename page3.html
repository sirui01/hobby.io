  <h2 id="Diet">Diet</h2>
<p>When you go into a pet shop, there are a wide variety of food available for different types of cats! Generally, cats need a balance of both dry and wet food. For dry food, I personally recommend "Royal Canin". They have a wide variety of dry food, with specialised formulas targeted for different cats. For instance, they have targeted dry foods for cats suffering with diabetes, liver disease, or those who are sensitive to their food.
<br>Look through this website to find out more about the different kind of food they offer!</br></p>

<h2>Grooming</h2>
<p>Although cats do groom themselves, there are some things we can help them with! For instance, we should make sure to trim their nails occassionally. This is easier said than done, and it can take one up to many tries to trim all of your cat's nails. A demonstration video can be viewed here:</p>

<p>Additionally, we can also groom their fur. As cats like to groom by licking their fur, they might end up ingesting too much loose fur, resulting in them vomitting a hair ball. To prevent this from happening, we can brush their fur frequently. Here's a tutorial video of how to do so:</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>It's a well-known fact that cats are generally way less active than dogs. Generally, most cats do not require regular walks and strolls. Instead, they can spend their whole day sleeping and only waking up for their meals (at least that is what my cats do). Hence, it is important to watch their diet and ensure that they are still getting their exercise at home to prevent them from becoming overweight. An overweight cat may pose an increased risk to certain health diseases, such as diabetes or heart diseases.
<br>To factor in some exercise with your cats, make sure to play with them frequently! Equip yourself with a bunch of cat teasers or other kinds of cat toys and start engaging your cat! Here's a short video on how Rummie plays with his favourite cat teaser toy.</br>

<h2>Most importantly...show them love!</h2>
<p>Showing your cats love and affection is the most important key to maintaining their health at home! Various owners like to show their love in different ways. For me, I love showering them with affection by always making a point to rub their tummies and their chins (when they allow me to). Here's a video that of Raisin enjoying her rubs!</p>

<p> Sometimes, your cats may even show love and affection back! For Raisin, she does this by constantly head-butting me.</p>
